1. Should I use v-if or v-show?
The answer is: it depends. If you have a component that is expensive to render, you might want to use v-if to only render it 
when it is needed. If you have a component that is cheap to render, you might want to use v-show to toggle it on and off.
V-show will always render the component, but it will toggle the CSS display property to hide it. V-if will only render the
component if the expression is true. If the expression is false, it will remove the component from the DOM.
